# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I work in ML and Data Science. Here are some of my projects:

- [Fraud Detection](https://github.com/AleksandrRodkin/FraudDetection) â€” detecting  of fraudulent applications with bank accounts
  - Got a realistic Bank Account Fraud Dataset from kaggle;
  - Performed EDA (the target class is imbalanced), Feature Engineering and data preprocessing;
  - Used Recall@5% FPR as the main metric (to balance the modelâ€™s accuracy and user experience);
  - Tuned baseline models (LR and SVC), Random Forest and XGB with TimeSeries CV.
  - Applied a paired statistical test on bootstrap subsamples to compare mean metric values for model selection;
  - Calibrated the probabilities of the XGB model with Plattâ€™s method and changed the predict method to limit FPR at 5% level;
  - Developed an API with FastAPI and containerized it using Docker.

- [Segmentation_MVTec_AD](https://github.com/AleksandrRodkin/Segmentation_MVTec_AD)
  - Task: Detect and segment defects on metal nuts at the pixel level using data from MVTec AD.
  - Dataset: The metal_nut subset from MVTec AD is used: training contains only normal, defect-free samples,
    while testing includes a mix of normal and defective samples. Binary masks indicate the exact locations of anomalies.
  - Architecture: ResNet50 is used for feature extraction, with MemoryNet (PatchCore-based) or UpMemoryNet (with refined masks,
    where outputs from the first ResNet layers are added during upsampling) for segmentation.
    These memory-based models help separate normal patterns from anomalous ones.
  - Training: The model is trained using a combined BCE + Dice loss, with AdamW optimizer and MultiStepLR scheduler.
    The pipeline includes image preprocessing, memory bank construction for embeddings, and segmentation evaluation using the Dice coefficient.
  - Results: The model successfully localizes scratches, cracks, and other defects.
    Visualizations include predicted vs. ground truth masks, anomaly heatmaps, and bounding boxes around defective regions.
